## ‚öôÔ∏è **Eletria Architecture**

### "Photon Emission by Controlled Electron-Ion Interaction in a Voxel Grid"

---

### üß± **Core Idea:**

A **vacuum-sealed or low-pressure chamber** contains a lightly ionized gas (like hydrogen or helium). **Directed electron beams** traverse the space to intersect at precise 3D coordinates (nodes), where **local electron-ion recombination** produces **visible photons** ‚Äî creating "lit voxels" in real 3D space.

---

### üß© System Components

#### 1. **Voxel Grid (3D Node Map)**

* A logical 3D matrix defining where "voxels" may be activated.
* Physically, this is an **empty volume** ‚Äî the nodes exist only as targetable coordinates in software.

#### 2. **Ionized Medium**

* Light ionization of a gas like **H‚ÇÇ, He, or Ne** ‚Äî selected for visible emission lines.
* Pressure and temperature tuned for optimal recombination visibility and safety.

#### 3. **Electron Beam Emitters (x2 or more)**

* Compact **electron guns** or field emitters aligned on different axes.
* Beam steering via **electrostatic or magnetic fields**.
* Aimed to cross paths **only at desired node locations**.

#### 4. **SpinStep Engine - [[Link]](https://github.com/VoxLeone/SpinStep)**

* Software module that:

  * Traverses the voxel space in time (frame-based or event-driven).
  * Computes beam paths to target a voxel.
  * Controls emitters and steering fields in real time.

#### 5. **Sensor & Feedback System (optional)**

* Optical or electron-density sensors could track voxel activation fidelity.
* Feedback loops adjust beam power or alignment dynamically.

## üîß **System Workflow**

1. **Initialization**: The SpinStep Engine initializes the 3D voxel grid and determines the coordinates of the voxels to be activated.

2. **Electron Beam Targeting**: The engine calculates the paths of electron beams to intersect at the specified voxel locations.

3. **Beam Emission**: Electron beam emitters direct beams to the calculated coordinates.

4. **Recombination and Emission**: At each intersection point, an electron recombines with an ion, emitting a visible photon and creating a voxel of light.

5. **Voxel Persistence**: The emitted light persists for a brief period, allowing for visual perception of the voxel.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations**

* **Beam Precision**: High precision is required to ensure electron beams intersect at the correct locations.
* **Gas Ionization**: Maintaining the appropriate level of ionization in the gas is crucial for efficient recombination.
* **Safety**: Proper shielding and safety protocols must be in place to handle electron beams and ionized gases.
