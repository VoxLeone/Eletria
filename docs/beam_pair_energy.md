## 🎯 Each Beam Contributes Part of the Energy

The **intersection point** of two beams becomes a **local energy concentration**. Each beam contributes a share of the necessary conditions for a photon emission event (e.g., via recombination, excitation, or collision-induced emission):

* **Electron Beam A** brings half the required **electron flux** (and energy density),
* **Electron Beam B** brings the other half,
* **Their product — not just their sum — determines the local activation rate**.

So the voxel “lights up” **only** where their **combined energy density** exceeds a **threshold for recombination** or **excitation**.

## 🌈 Wavelength (Color) Depends on Interaction Energy

Yes — the **color of the emitted photon** depends on:

* The **type of ion** (e.g., H⁺, He⁺, Ne⁺),
* The **energy transferred** in the recombination/excitation,
* The **final energy state** of the ionized atom or molecule.

If you're targeting specific visible wavelengths:

* You may choose a **gas mixture** where recombination yields light in **RGB bands**,
* Or, in future versions, **modulate the energy of the beams** to adjust the emission line (if feasible).

In either case, the **intersection intensity (e.g., keV/cm²)** must be high enough to ensure photon emission, but **precisely controlled** to hit the right energy transition.

## 🧠 Simplified Model

Let’s say a certain voxel requires a **recombination event** that emits green light (wavelength ≈ 550 nm). The corresponding photon energy is:

$$
E_{\gamma} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} ≈ \frac{(6.626×10^{-34} \cdot 3×10^8)}{550×10^{-9}} ≈ 2.25 \text{ eV}
$$

To reliably trigger this emission:

* The **total energy density at the voxel** must enable an **electron-ion recombination event** that can drop an electron into the correct state.
* If each beam is tuned to deliver \~**half the required flux or excitation probability**, then **only at their crossing point** does the necessary condition arise.

## ✅ Summary

* ✔️ **Yes**, each beam contributes part of the **energy density** required for activation.
* ✔️ The voxel **only lights up** when both beams overlap in space and time.
* ✔️ The **emitted color** depends on interaction physics — primarily the **type of ionized gas** and **recombination energy**.
