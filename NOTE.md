# Note: 

Some assumptions regarding the validity of the electron beam pair method have proven to be incorrect, which places this solution on shaky ground. Nevertheless, I believe it is worthwhile to keep this project publicly available for several reasons:

a) it relies on the advanced software we are developing for traversing three-dimensional graphs — the Spinstep library — which goes hand in hand with this project;
b) it allows other developers, hackers, contributors, and the general public to engage with both initiatives;
c) it supports an alternative pathway to the patent system for sharing this idea.

We are currently working on a variant of this concept that combines lasers with electron beams. This approach appears to be more robust and will be published soon.
